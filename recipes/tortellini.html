<h2> Description </h2>
<p>Tons of flavor in this tortellini with Italian sausage! Your family will love this!</p>

<h3> Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 (8 ounce) package baby portobello mushrooms, sliced</li>
<li>1 cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio), divided</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
<li>10 ounces mild Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package three-cheese tortellini</li>
<li>14 Â½ ounces Alfredo basil sauce</li>
<li>1 (5 ounce) package baby spinach leaves</li>
</ul>

<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol> 
<li>Heat butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, 1/2 cup white wine, and 1 clove minced garlic until liquid has reduced and mushrooms have softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and place in a bowl.</li>
<li>Heat the same skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir Italian sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes, dividing it into bite-sized portions while stirring. Remove excess grease by placing paper towels onto a plate and dumping browned sausage onto it to drain. Return sausage to the skillet.</li>
<li>Return cooked mushrooms back to the skillet with sausage and add tortellini, Alfredo basil sauce, remaining 1/2 cup white wine, and remaining garlic. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes. Add spinach; cover and cook until spinach is wilted, 3 to 4 minutes more. Mix well to combine. Remove from heat and serve.</li>
